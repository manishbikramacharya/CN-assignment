The IPv6 header is 40 bytes long and includes the following fields:

- **Version (4 bits)**
- **Traffic Class (8 bits)**
- **Flow Label (20 bits)**
- **Payload Length (16 bits)**
- **Next Header (8 bits)**
- **Hop Limit (8 bits)**
- **Source Address (128 bits)**
- **Destination Address (128 bits)**

### Purpose of Each Header Field

#### a) Version (4 bits)
Indicates the version of the Internet Protocol being used. Possible values are:
- `0100` for IPv4
- `0110` for IPv6

#### b) Traffic Class (8 bits)
- **Differentiated Services Field (DS field, 6 bits):** Used to classify packets. All standard DS fields end with '0'.
- **Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN, 2 bits):** Indicates congestion control traffic. The source provides congestion control and non-congestion control traffic.

#### c) Flow Label (20 bits)
Facilitates the efficient routing and handling of packets belonging to the same flow. A flow is a sequence of packets sent from a particular source to a particular destination, requiring special handling such as:
1. Prioritized delivery
2. Bandwidth guarantees
3. Low-latency transmission

This is essential for real-time applications such as VoIP, online gaming, and video conferencing.

#### d) Payload Length (16 bits)
Specifies the length of the payload carried by the IPv6 packet, including the data portion and any extension headers following the basic IPv6 header.

#### e) Next Header (8 bits)
Specifies the type of the next header. This field usually indicates the transport layer protocol used by the packet's payload (e.g., UDP). When extension headers are present, this field indicates which extension header follows.

#### f) Hop Limit (8 bits)
Specifies the maximum number of routers a packet can traverse. The value is decremented by 1 each time the packet passes through a router. This prevents packets from looping indefinitely.

#### g) Source Address (128 bits)
Specifies the address from which the packet is sent.

#### h) Destination Address (128 bits)
Specifies the address to which the packet is to be sent.
