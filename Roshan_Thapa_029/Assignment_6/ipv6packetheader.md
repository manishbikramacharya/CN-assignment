# This is the solution of the question no.2 of the task.md of the Assignment_06.

# The answer in this particular file solution2.txt is based on the packet with Frame:26 of file ipv6.pcapng and the screenshot is also given as ipv6.png.

Headers and their values:
1) **Version (4 bits)**:
    - **Value**: 0x6
    - **Description**: The value 0x6, seen as 6 in the first 4 bits of the highlighted text, indicates that the packet is using IPv6.

2) **Traffic Class (6+2 bits)**:
    - **Value**: 0x00
    - **Description**: The value 0x00 means the packet is of normal type with no special Quality of Service requested. The first 6 bits (0x00) indicate normal priority, and the last 2 bits indicate that no explicit congestion notification is requested.

3) **Flow Label (20 bits)**:
    - **Value**: 0xee96
    - **Description**: The value 0xee96 is used by the source to indicate that packets with this flow label belong to the same flow, allowing routers and switches to provide special handling for this flow.

4) **Payload Length (16 bits)**:
    - **Value**: 32 (0x0020)
    - **Description**: This indicates that the payload of the IPv6 packet, including any extension headers and transport layer data, is 32 bytes long.

5) **Next Header (8 bits)**:
    - **Value**: 0x06
    - **Description**: The value 0x06 indicates that the next header is a TCP header. Other possible values could be 0x11 for UDP header, 0x3A for ICMPv6, etc.

6) **Hop Limit (8 bits)**:
    - **Value**: 0x40
    - **Description**: The value 0x40 means the packet is allowed to be forwarded by up to 64 routers. Each time a router forwards the packet, it decreases the Hop Limit by one. When the Hop Limit reaches zero, the packet is discarded to prevent it from looping indefinitely in the network.

7) **Source Address (128 bits)**:
    - **Value**: `2400:1a00:b1e0:c10:ccae:41c4:eca3:6a81`
    - **Description**: This is the IPv6 address of the sender.

8) **Destination Address (128 bits)**:
    - **Value**: `2606:4700:10::ac43:944`
    - **Description**: This is the IPv6 address of the receiver.
